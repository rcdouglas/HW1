    <h3>Character Bio</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Mann was an astronaut and scientist that was part of the Lazarus Missions as depicted in the movie <i>Interstellar</i>.
      Played by Matt Damon in the exact same role as Mark Watney in <i>The Martian</i>,
      Dr. Mann was stranded on icy planet while searching the galaxy for potentially hospitable worlds.
      When Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), crew member of the <i>Endurance</i>,
      landed on the planet and awakened Dr. Mann from cryo-sleep, Dr. Mann displayed his gratefulness by leading Cooper on a wild goose chase
      before attempting to kill him, steal his shuttle, and return to the <i>Endurance</i>.
      While he did make it off the planet with Cooper in hot pursuit, he botched the docking he had no prayer of completing,
      and turns into space dust. Bad karma, good cameo.
